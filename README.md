# Overview: Predicting Wine Quality
We will be assuming that wine can be classified as “good quality” or “bad quality” based on certain physio-chemical characteristics of the wine.
The dataset selected contains data about red and white wine variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The data contains features of wine to be used for this project to predict an output of “good”or “bad” quality based on a preset scale: 0-10.
Several tools will be used to inspect and clean the datasets. Scikit-Learn will also be used for machine learning training and testing. The data set will be uploaded to a SQL database.
